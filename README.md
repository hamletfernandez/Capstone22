# Capstone22
This repository will hold the code for my Media, Arts, and Design Capstone project developed during Winter 2022. 

Instructions: The experience focuses on creating art using a keyboard. It maps the number of keys held at one time 
to different effcts within the art frame. On Mac keyboards the limit to how many keys you can press may be 6, but this project supports up to 30!
