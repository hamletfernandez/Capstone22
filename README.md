# Capstone22
This repository holds my Media, Arts, and Design Capstone project developed during the Winter 2022 quarter. 

Please feel free to check out the project at:

Instructions: The experience focuses on creating art using a keyboard. It maps the number of keys held at one time 
to different effects within the art frame. On some keyboards the limit to how many keys you can press may be 6, but this project supports up to 30 keys!
